# 04-pointers

Especially for this topic, for now, I prefer you to watch a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuegQmMdy8M) video from the start until `Character arrays and pointers - part 2`.
The reason for this is that the concept of pointers is better presented with illustrations.

Note: If you want to arrange a tutorial session, please collectively suggest a proper time.
